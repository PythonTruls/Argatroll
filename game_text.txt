The year is 1578 and the troll species 'mad men' are going extinct.
You are working as a researcher for the kings laboratort 
on a mission to get the species on track again.
Altough, as their name suggest they are easily 
aggrevated by the sight of a felllow troll.
Your goal is to place out all the trolls in 
your possession without making them angry.

These are the rules:
1. You may place one troll at a time (per row)
2. Trolls get mad when they see another troll in the same row, 
   column or diagonal
